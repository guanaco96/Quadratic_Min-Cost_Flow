# Quadratic_Min-Cost_Flow

This report is devoted to the project of "Computational Mathematics for 
learing and data analysis", prof. Frangioni and Poloni, UniPi 2018/19.

This is an implementation of Conjugate Gradient method employed to solve
quadratic separable min-cost flow problem. You can find report.pdf
attached, it explains how this project was conducted.

How to use this code?

You can find all the relevant methods in cg.py, they are well documented.
Moreover you can find some code I employed to script experiments.
